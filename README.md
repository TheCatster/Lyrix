Lyrix displays lyrics taken from the Genius API for any song playing on Spotify!

## Usage
This app should be configured individually, so add your IDs where needed in the app.py. Once finished with that, I would recommend using something like py-to-exe to package it as an exe and make it simpler to run. I won't include releases since they contain my information.

## Improvements

- [x] GUI using Tkinter
- [x] Automatically switch lyrics
- [ ] Dark Mode
